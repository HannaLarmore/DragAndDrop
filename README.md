# DragAndDrop
Have figured out almost everything except:
  1. how to serialize data coming in currently as null
  2. how to get canvases to be the right size
I belive once serializing data is figured out I should be able to achieve the drop portion of drag and drop
however I do end at the event for dropping on my other viewmodel so I know at least event wise everything is 
hooked up okay although needs some cleaning event wise from when I was experimenting with serialization and dragging.
